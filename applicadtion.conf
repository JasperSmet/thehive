## ANALYZERS
#
# This section holds the configuration of the analyzers.
#
# Please note that MISP expansion modules have  their  separate  section
# (see MISP EXPANSION MODULES below).
#
# NOTE: you are highly advised to remove the configuration parts related
# to unneeded/unused analyzers.
#
# NOTE: if you don't need an analyzer, please remove  the  corresponding
# directory. For example, if you don't use 'MaxMind', remove:
# /path/to/Cortex-Analyzers/analyzers/MaxMind
#
# WARNING: there is overlap between Cortex  native  analyzers  and  MISP
# expansion modules. We  highly  advise  you  to  use  native  analyzers
# whenever possible.
#
# WARNING: DO NOT CONFIGURE A CORTEX ANALYZER AND A MISP MODULE FOR  THE
# SAME SERVICE.
